# Magical Research Minigame — Rules Summary

## 1. Research Session Overview

- Research is performed in sessions
- Each session has:
  - Limited Focus (hard time limit)
  - Limited Insight (soft power)
  - A Cohesion value representing theory stability
- Sessions end when:
  - Focus reaches 0
  - Player voluntarily ends
  - Cohesion collapses catastrophically

---

## 2. Spell Setup

- Player selects a Spell Intent
  - Domain (eg Light)
  - Constraints (eg Low intensity, Non-combat)
  - Desired effects
- Spell Intent determines:
  - Tile pool
  - Minimum cohesion required at completion
  - Minimum theory density requirements

---

## 3. Board

- Fixed 3×3 grid (expandable later)
- Tiles are placed orthogonally
- Adjacency is orthogonal only
- Board state persists between sessions

---

## 4. Resources

### Focus
- Starts at 10 per session
- −1 per turn
- Spent on most actions
- When Focus reaches 0, session ends immediately

### Insight
- Starts at 2 per session
- Soft cap at 6
- Gained from integration and some weather effects
- Spent on integration, stabilization, and powerful actions

### Cohesion
- Starts at 10
- Represents theory health
- Reduced by volatility, adjacency pressure, and some weather
- Required to remain above a threshold to complete a spell

---

## 5. Tiles

Each tile has:
- Name
- Base mechanical effect
- Tag:
  - Consensus
  - Tenuous
  - Crackpot
- Base volatility (1–3)
- Integration Level (integer)
- Maximum Integration Level determined by tag

### Maximum Integration Levels

| Tag        | Max Level |
|------------|-----------|
| Consensus  | 3         |
| Tenuous    | 2         |
| Crackpot   | 1         |

---

## 6. Progressive Integration

- Tiles begin at Integration Level 0
- Integration Level determines:
  - Effect strength
  - Volatility
- Effect scaling:
  - effect = base_effect × (integration_level / max_level)
- Volatility scaling:
  - volatility = base_volatility × (1 − integration_level / max_level)

---

## 7. Integration Actions

### Deepen Integration
- Cost: 1 Focus + Insight (scales by tag and level)
- Increases Integration Level by +1
- Cohesion change per level:
  - Consensus: +1
  - Tenuous: 0
  - Crackpot: −1
- Crackpot tiles can only be integrated once

### Per-Session Limits
- Maximum total integration levels gained per session (eg 3)
- Integration Insight costs increase on heavily refined spells

---

## 8. Placement

### Place Tile
- Cost: 1 Focus
- Tile is placed at Integration Level 0
- Cohesion − base volatility immediately

---

## 9. Adjacency Rules

### Adjacency Pressure (per turn)

| Pair                  | Effect          |
|-----------------------|-----------------|
| Consensus–Consensus   | +1 cohesion     |
| Consensus–Tenuous     | 0               |
| Tenuous–Tenuous       | 0               |
| Consensus–Crackpot    | −1 cohesion     |
| Tenuous–Crackpot      | −1 cohesion     |
| Crackpot–Crackpot     | −2 cohesion     |

- Unintegrated tiles apply full penalty
- Integrated tiles apply 50% penalty (rounded down, minimum −1 if any penalty exists)

### Adjacency Effect Bonuses
- Adjacent Consensus tile: +10% effect
- Adjacent Crackpot tile: +20% effect
- Adjacent Tenuous tile: no bonus

---

## 10. Actions

### Examine Source
- Cost: 1 Focus
- Draw 2 random tiles, keep 1

### Stabilize Theory
- Cost: 1 Focus + 1 Insight
- Cohesion +3

### Speculative Leap
- Cost: 2 Focus + 2 Insight
- Generate a powerful Crackpot tile
- Cohesion −2

---

## 11. Weather (Epistemic Conditions)

- Weather changes every 3 turns
- Weather effects apply at start of turn
- Examples:
  - Inspired: +1 Insight
  - Dogmatic: Integration costs −1 Insight
  - Chaotic: Crackpot adjacency penalties doubled
  - Stagnant: Examine Source yields only 1 tile
- Weather cannot be skipped or waited out safely

---

## 12. Turn Structure

Each turn:
1. Weather effects apply
2. Adjacency pressure is applied
3. Player performs one action
4. Focus −1
5. Check for session end

---

## 13. Spell Completion Requirements

To complete a spell:
- Minimum Cohesion (spell-dependent, eg ≥6)
- Minimum integrated tile count (eg ≥4)
- Minimum adjacency links (eg ≥5)
- Final cohesion check includes persistent penalties

---

## 14. Session End and Persistence

At session end:
- Board layout is saved
- Integration levels are saved
- Cohesion resets to:
  - min(starting cohesion, final cohesion + 2)
- Unintegrated tiles may be lost on collapse
- Partial success preserves reusable theory tiles

---

## 15. Design Constraints (Intentional)

- No action fully removes risk
- Crackpot ideas are powerful but permanently destabilizing
- Perfect stability is asymptotic
- Revisiting spells is expected and meaningful
- Small, safe spells are reliable but weak
